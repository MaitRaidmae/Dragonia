# Dragonia
Dragons Of Mugloar thingy
<h1>Requirements</h1>
This was built in Python 3.5 Don't really know which other Python versions it functions with. The "Run from your virtual environment" refers to the Directories <PythonEnv>/bin/ in Unix or <PytonEnv>\Scripts in Windows - the commands run are Python scripts that are located on those paths.
<h1>Installation instructions</h1>
<b>Step 1</b>: Create a Python virtual environment.  
<b>Step 2</b>: Update your pip and setuptools.  
<b>Step 3</b>: Browse to the source folder in a command line client and from your virtual environment run (note the . in the end) "pip install -e .".  
<b>Step 4</b>: From your virtual environment in a command line client run "initialize_dragonia_db development.ini" (or another .ini file if you are so inclined).  
<b>Step 5</b>: From your virtual environment in a command line client run "pserve development.ini" (again another .ini can be used).  
<b>Step 6</b>: Open localhost:6543 in your browser (the login screen should open there).
<h1>A bit about the Thing</h1>
Basic things you can do:  
* Create a new pet/user.
* Initate a battle and choose a dragon (there are four clumsy ones Flamy, Clawy, Scaly and Wingy - and Glaurung who should be a bit more adept at eating knights).
* View stats of your Dragons (Visit Dragon Den). Glaurung should achieve over 60% Success Rate at knight Consumations.

Please do try to forgive me the visual awfulness of the thing (UI not really my thing).
